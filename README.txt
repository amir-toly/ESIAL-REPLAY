ESIAL-REPLAY
============
In this project, you will find some practical exercises I have done in class.
Since my school name was ESIAL, the project name comes from itself: ESIAL-REPLAY.

It will be about Java (exceptions, inheritance, etc.), C (pointers, structures, etc.)
Most of the essential concepts around programming will be covered.

Each git branch will refer to an exercise. The corresponding root folder contains a README file to help you understand the context.
